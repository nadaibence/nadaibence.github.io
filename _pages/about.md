<p>Hello Everyone! </p>

<p>My name is Bence Nadai and I am the author of the blog. I live in Budapest, Hungary and I am a full-stack data scientist. I have started doing DS in the university and I've been doing that eversince. My main language is python and therefore most of the blogposts that I post are using python code snippets.</p>

<p>I enjoy every aspect of DS, it can be model building, optimization or buildig ETL pipelines to ingest data. At the company where I'm working it is required to be able to work solo, so you have to know a little bit of everything. Due to this I had to pick up lots of knowledge from different areas. I know how to build complex architecture in the cloud or how to ship the data product to the customers on-prem environment.</p>

<p>The aim of this blog is to share my knowledge with you through my personal experiences. I have learned a lot thanks to the community and I want to give back.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, drop me an <a href="mailto:nadai.bence.endre@gmail.com">email</a>, or ping me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/n%C3%A1dai-bence-882673149/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
